TicTacToe

Easy mode: randomly generate a spot and pray (Random.x Random.y)

Hard mode: it will try to win (MinMax local gain and global gain)

PS. I think I only edited the TicTacTocAI.cs has all the edits and documentations.

Note: this was a fun project because I haven't touched Unity for a long while (roughly 5~6 years) and seeing it being a lot more user friendly shed a tear into my eyes. It is definitely fun to play around!!
